#   Welcome to the ReBlock Documentation archive!

In this repository by [yours truly](https://github.com/yourworstnightmare1), the team has archived every page from the ReBlock Documentation as we will no longer use our old Wix domains in favor for more accessable domains made with [Google Sites](https://www.sites.google.com/view/reblock), also meaning that the documentation site will be moving with everything else.

# Available items

Here is an overview of everything to be available here:

| Article Name | Date Published | Available on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Safe Boot - The Key to Success | 3/30/2023 | GitHub |
| Safe Boot - The Key to Success (Part 2) | 4/4/2023 | GitHub |
| Safe Boot - The Key to Success (Intel version) | 4/3/2023 | GitHub |
| How to extract package files with Terminal | 4/6/2023 | GitHub |

There wasn't much on the site we made, thankfully. The Wix sites just had some privacy/security issues that we do not want to deal with, so that is why we are shutting down on Wix and completely reopening on Google Sites.

We hope you like it!
